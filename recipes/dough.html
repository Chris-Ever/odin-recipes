        <h2>Simple. Fluffy. Versitile.</h2>
        <p>Bao buns, or more properly "Baozi", are a type of Chinese steamed bun with a savory filling.
            There are a wide variety of Bao that appear throughout Asia; from the familiar Chinese BBQ 
            pork Char Siu Bao, to the less familiar Vietnamese sausage and quail egg filled Bahn Bao, to 
            the outright unusual pizza-stuffed manju found in Japanese convenience stores. </p>

        <p>Whatever the filling, however, the vast majority of bao I have encountered all have one thing 
            in common: a fluffy, steamed, bready dough encapsulating the savory contents.</p>
        <p>This recipe will give you the essential foundation for any number of bao varieties. What you 
            fill it with is up to you! If you are struggling for inspiration, try our Char Siu, 
            Tikka Masala, or Buffalo Chicken fillings.</p>
