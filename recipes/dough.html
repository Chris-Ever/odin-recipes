        <h1>Basic Bao Dough</h1>

        <h2>Simple. Fluffy. Versitile.</h2>
        <p>Bao buns, or more properly "Baozi", are a type of Chinese steamed bun with a savory filling.
            There are a wide variety of Bao that appear throughout Asia; from the familiar Chinese BBQ 
            pork Char Siu Bao, to the less familiar Vietnamese sausage and quail egg filled Bahn Bao, to 
            the outright unusual pizza-stuffed manju found in Japanese convenience stores. </p>

        <p>Whatever the filling, however, the vast majority of bao I have encountered all have one thing 
            in common: a fluffy, steamed, bready dough encapsulating the savory contents.</p>
        <p>This recipe will give you the essential foundation for any number of bao varieties. What you 
            fill it with is up to you!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tsp active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3/4 cup warm water</li>
            <li>2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>5 tbs sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup canola oil</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer, disolve the yeast in the warm water
                Sift together the flour and cornstarch and add it to the yeast mixture
                along with the sugar and oil. Turn the mixer onto the lowest setting and 
                let it go until a smooth dough ball is formed. Cover with a damp cloth 
                and let it rest for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>While dough is resting prepare your filling of choice. (If you are struggling 
                for inspiration, try our Char Siu or Buffalo Chicken fillings!)</li>
            <li>After your dough has rested for 2 hours, add the baking powder to the dough 
                and turn the mixer on to the lowest setting. At this point, if the dough looks 
                dry or you're having trouble incorporating the baking powder, add 1-2 teaspoons 
                water. Gently knead the dough until it becomes smooth again. Cover with a damp 
                cloth and let it rest for another 15 minutes. In the meantime, get a large piece 
                of parchment paper and cut it into ten 4x4 inch squares. Prepare your steamer 
                by bringing the water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Now we are ready to assemble the buns: roll the dough into a long tube and divide 
                it into 10 equal pieces. Press each piece of dough into a disc about 4 1/2 inches 
                in diameter (it should be thicker in the center and thinner around the edges). 
                Add some filling and pleat the buns until they're closed on top.</li>
            <li>Place each bun on a parchment paper square, and steam. I steamed the buns in two 
                separate batches using a bamboo steamer (be sure the boiling water does not touch 
                the buns during steaming process). Once the water boils, place the buns in the steamer 
                and steam each batch for 12 minutes over high heat.</li>
        </ol>
